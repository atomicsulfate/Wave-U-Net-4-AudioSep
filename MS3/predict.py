    '''
    Predicts the separation of a given song into the specified sources (i.e. "instruments"), specifying a
    level of confidence in the prediction.
    :param x: An audio sample for which the source separation must be predicted, as returned
    by the function 'load_data' (see Milestone 1).
    :param sources: Audio sources to predict ("accompaniment", "vocals", "bass", "drums", "other").
    :param sr: Sampling rate of the input.
    :param model: The trained model to be used for the prediction.
    :returns: A pair whose first element is the predicted separation, and second is a normalized measurement (0-1) for
    the confidence in the given prediction.
    The prediction is a dictionary where each key is the source name and the value is an array containing the predicted
    audio time series.
