    Returns an explanation of the predicted separation of an input song into its sources or instruments.
    :param x: An audio sample for which the source separation must be predicted, as returned
    by the function 'load_data' (see Milestone 1).
    :param sources: Audio sources to predict ("accompaniment", "vocals", "bass", "drums", "other").
    :param resolution: Resolution of the explanation in milliseconds.
    :param sr: Sampling rate of the input.
    :param model: The trained model to be used for the prediction. If none passed, a default will be used.
    :returns: An 3D array of size (n,n,s), with n the number of audio windows per source at the given time resolution and
    s the number of sources.
    Element (i,j,k) is a normalized value [0-1] of the importance that input window i has on the prediction of output
    window j for source k.
